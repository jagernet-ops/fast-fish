# 🎣 Fast-Fish! 🐟

## Date of Collaboration - 04/28/23

### Repository Information:

Inside of this repository you'll find the code for *Fast-Fish!* JLH and MJS's final evidence for our Junior Year Intro to Programming class. While the assignment looked for a submission in python, we decided to go a little more free form and create a Web Application to both display our comprehension of the information imparted during class periods, as well as a preparatory project for the Summer Northwestern Mutual *hi Tech* Minicamp/Internship.

### Project Details:

*Fast-Fish!* implements both Typescript for the backend as well as ReactJS for frontend elements to provide the user with a _*High Octane*_ card playing experience! 😁
